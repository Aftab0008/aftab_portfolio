          About Me
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          I'm a dedicated full-stack developer and creative technologist with hands-on experience in building modern, scalable web applications and visual experiences. My technical expertise spans across both frontend and backend development using technologies like
          <span className="font-semibold text-indigo-500"> React.js, Node.js, Express, JavaScript, Java, and Vite</span>, combined with styling frameworks such as
          <span className="font-semibold text-indigo-500"> Tailwind CSS</span>.
          I work confidently with databases including
          <span className="font-semibold text-indigo-500"> PostgreSQL and SQL</span>, and have deployed applications on servers like
          <span className="font-semibold text-indigo-500"> Apache Tomcat</span> and through modern platforms like
          <span className="font-semibold text-indigo-500"> Render, Railway, and Vercel</span>.
          In addition to software development, I have a strong creative side, having worked with design tools like
          <span className="font-semibold text-indigo-500"> Canva</span>, and 3D modeling and animation software such as
          <span className="font-semibold text-indigo-500"> Blender and Autodesk Maya</span>, enabling me to create immersive interfaces and engaging digital experiences that merge aesthetics with performance.
